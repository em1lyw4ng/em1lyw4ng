i'm a soon-to-be computer science graduate, currently based out of los angeles-ish and born in new york city-ish. 

most of my experience is with mobile development (iOS specifically), but i'm looking to branch out 🏕. 

i like to crochet, hang out with my cat, spend some time outdoors, or watch a lot of food-related content. 

🌱 now:
* learning react native by building something fun
* researching NLP in {clinical, literature} corpora
* brushing up on data structures & algorithms to prepare for my final semester of TAing!

📖 (technical) interests:
* computer systems
* back-end development
